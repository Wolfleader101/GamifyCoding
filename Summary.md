# Summary so i can remember the idea

Basically a fun way to get you motivated to code. i heard about gamification. basically it means that you make everything you do IRL like an RPG game with quests. Set everything as a challenge and complete it and receive a reward depending on the task. It is self moderated so you need self control so you don't abuse the system. The same way games get you hooked on enjoyment with the chemicals in your body called Dopamine and Serotonin this can too! These chemical are responsible for the sense of reward, feeling good, wellbeing and most of all happiness

The idea of this app is to easily allow you to break down your coding project into small challenges and make it feel rewarding when you complete these challenges. It would also encourage you to keep going and not stopping. I have designed this for my personal need to want to code but also wanting to play games. Instead of me coding when i really know i should i will launch a game and get distracted. i thought this is due to lack of ideas, boredom, etc etc but it turns out it is actually me wanting to feel the satisfaction of reward of winning a match, getting achievements, etc. So hopefully this helps gives me and other people motivation to code when we really want to be don't. Or going to bed and being like dam, i actually did something today instead of "Tomorrow i will do this, this and this then i'll feel good and i'll continue doing that, that and that. This whole project can be applied to anything.

When you start the timer the "Game" starts. When you first launch you will not have a profile and will be level zero. This means that every hour of coding means 30 minutes of doing another activity such as gaming. Now 1 hour doesn't mean sitting their for 50 minutes doing nothing but sitting blankly on chrome or browsing sites or writing up documents it means actually coding. Unfortunately i don't think their is a way (at least if it is a Javascript Project) i can implement a way to check if they are coding, however i am sure i could find a way to integrate with vscode but trying to integrate with every IDE and text editor would be nearly impossible. (Checking keyboard input is also possible)

After a certain amount of time you earn a certain amount of xp which counts towards your levels, the higher your level the greater time you get to play games. However i haven't actually decided how this works. It will basically be something like this:

* anything less than 1 hour not counted.
* 1 hour of coding = 100xp + 20min of gaming time.
* 2 hours of coding = 250xp + 50min of gaming time.

* level 0 multiplier = 0%;
* level 1 multiplier = 0.05%
* level 2 multiplier = 0.1%
